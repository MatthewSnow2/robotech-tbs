## ðŸ§ª Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests (EditMode)
```csharp
[Test]
public void TechPrerequisites_BlocksUnavailableTechs()
{
    // Arrange
    var reactorMk2 = CreateTech(..., prerequisites: reactorMk1);
    var techManager = new TechManager();

    // Act
    bool canResearch = techManager.IsTechAvailable(reactorMk2);

    // Assert
    Assert.IsFalse(canResearch, "Should not be able to research Reactor Mk II without Mk I");
}

[Test]
public void EraTransition_UnlocksNextGeneration()
{
    // Arrange
    var protocultureDiscovery = CreateTech(...);
    protocultureDiscovery.allowsEraTransition = true;
    var techManager = new TechManager();
    techManager.currentGeneration = TechGeneration.Gen0;

    // Act
    techManager.SetResearch(protocultureDiscovery);
    techManager.AddScience(1000); // Force completion

    // Assert
    Assert.AreEqual(TechGeneration.Gen1, techManager.currentGeneration);
}
```

### Integration Tests (Play Mode)
- [ ] Start new game, research Protoculture Discovery, verify Gen 1 unlocks
- [ ] Research Transformation Engineering I, verify VF-0 can be produced
- [ ] Complete Reactor Mk II, verify +15 Protoculture per turn applied
- [ ] Research all Gen 3 techs, verify no crashes or missing dependencies

### Balance Testing
- [ ] Play full match focusing Air path (VF-1 rush)
- [ ] Play full match focusing Ground path (Destroid wall)
- [ ] Play full match focusing Tech path (economy/science)
- [ ] Verify all paths reach victory condition in ~40-60 turns

## ðŸ“Š Success Criteria

**MVP Tech Tree is complete when:**
- [ ] All Gen 0-3 techs implemented and testable
- [ ] Prerequisite system prevents researching locked techs
- [ ] Era transitions work (Gen 0 â†’ Gen 1 â†’ Gen 2 â†’ Gen 3)
- [ ] Unit production checks tech requirements
- [ ] Tech effects apply to resources and units
- [ ] UI allows selecting and viewing techs
- [ ] All three strategic paths are viable
- [ ] No critical bugs or crashes

**Stretch Goals:**
- [ ] Gen 4 fully implemented
- [ ] Visual tech tree graph (Civ6-style)
- [ ] Tech icons for all techs
- [ ] Gen 5 defined for future expansion

---

## ðŸš§ Known Challenges

### Challenge 1: Balancing Science Costs
**Problem:** Hard to predict turn timing without extensive playtesting
**Mitigation:**
- Start with formula-based costs (Gen X = 10 * (1.5^X))
- Playtest and adjust
- Make costs easily tweakable (ScriptableObject)

### Challenge 2: Unit Upgrade in Field
**Problem:** Applying tech bonuses to existing units
**Mitigation:**
- Store original stats in UnitDefinition
- Apply multipliers/bonuses when tech completes
- Units keep bonuses even if "downgraded" (no tech loss mechanic)

### Challenge 3: UI Complexity
**Problem:** 60+ techs is a lot to display
**Mitigation:**
- Filter by generation (show only current + next)
- Filter by category (Power/Mecha/Weapons tabs)
- Search/filter functionality

### Challenge 4: Save/Load
**Problem:** Need to persist researched techs
**Mitigation:**
- Store list of `techId` strings in save file
- Reconstruct `researchedTechs` list on load
- Reapply all tech effects to resources/units

## ðŸ”— Dependencies

**Must be implemented first:**
- [x] ResourceManager (Science accumulation)
- [x] TurnManager (Per-turn science from cities)
- [x] City/District system (Science yields from Lab districts)
- [ ] Enhanced TechDefinition (this roadmap)
- [ ] Enhanced TechManager (this roadmap)

**Blocks:**
- [ ] Unit production UI (needs tech unlock checks)
- [ ] Advanced units (VF-1 line blocked by Transformation Engineering II)
- [ ] Late-game balance (needs full tech tree to test)

---

## ðŸ“… Suggested Timeline

**Week 1:** Phase 1-2 (Enhanced data layer, TechManager)
**Week 2:** Phase 3 (Gen 2-3 definitions, balancing)
**Week 3:** Phase 4 (UI implementation)
**Week 4:** Phase 5 (Gen 4, polish, testing)

**Total:** ~4 weeks for complete Gen 0-4 tech tree system

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

1. **Review TECH_TREE.md** - Familiarize with all 60+ technologies
2. **Create TechGeneration and TechCategory enums** - Add to Data namespace
3. **Expand TechDefinition.cs** - Add all new fields from Phase 1
4. **Create CreateTech() factory method** - Enable rapid tech creation
5. **Define Gen 0 techs** - Start small (3-4 techs) to test system
6. **Test prerequisite logic** - Verify TechManager.IsTechAvailable() works

**After that, proceed phase-by-phase through this roadmap.**
