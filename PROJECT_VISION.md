# Robotech: Macross Era - Project Vision

**Last Updated:** 2025-10-23
**Status:** Design + Early Scaffolding Phase
**Target:** Single-Player Turn-Based Strategy Game

---

## 🎯 Core Vision

**Create a deep, authentic Robotech turn-based strategy experience that combines the best of Civilization VI's 4X gameplay with the tactical intensity of the Macross conflict.**

This is not just another 4X game with a Robotech skin - it's a carefully crafted experience that respects both the strategic depth of Civilization and the unique flavor of Robotech's First Robotech War.

---

## 🌟 Project Pillars

### 1. **Authentic Robotech Experience**
- **Faction Identity Matters:** RDF and Zentradi should feel fundamentally different
  - RDF: Technological adaptability, transformable units, defensive strength
  - Zentradi: Overwhelming numbers, raw power, aggressive expansion
- **Lore-Driven Design:** Every unit, tech, and mechanic should reflect Macross canon
- **Protoculture as Core Resource:** Not just "mana" - it's the strategic lynchpin of the conflict

### 2. **Strategic Depth (Civ6-Inspired)**
- **Meaningful Choices:** Every turn should present interesting decisions
- **Multiple Paths to Victory:** Tech rush vs military conquest vs expansion
- **Risk vs Reward:** Aggressive expansion vs consolidation and development
- **Long-Form Engagement:** 2-6 hour sessions that tell a story

### 3. **Tactical Combat Excellence**
- **Robotech Tactics Foundation:** Based on Palladium's tactical combat
- **Unit Abilities Matter:** Transformation modes, missile salvos, ECM - not just stat sticks
- **Terrain and Positioning:** Elevation, cover, range bands create tactical puzzles
- **Air/Ground Layering:** Veritechs dominate the sky; battlepods control the ground

### 4. **Approachable Complexity**
- **Easy to Learn:** Core loop understandable in 30 minutes
- **Hard to Master:** Strategic depth emerges over multiple sessions
- **Transparent Systems:** Players should understand WHY things happen
- **Quality of Life:** Modern UI/UX expectations (auto-saves, undo, clear feedback)

## 🎮 What Makes This Game Unique

### The "Civilization Meets Robotech" Hybrid

**From Civilization VI:**
- Hex-based map with rich terrain variety
- City building with districts and specialization
- Technology tree unlocking new capabilities
- Fog of war and exploration
- Long-form session structure

**From Robotech/Tactical Games:**
- Unit transformation mechanics (Fighter/Gerwalk/Battloid)
- Detailed combat with weapon types, armor classes, abilities
- Protoculture scarcity driving strategy
- Faction asymmetry reflecting lore
- Tactical combat resolution

**Unique Synthesis:**
- **Protoculture Economy:** Not gold or production - a unique strategic resource that powers everything
- **Transformation Strategy:** Veritech modes create strategic choices beyond movement
- **Asymmetric Factions:** RDF and Zentradi play completely differently
- **Combat Layers:** Air superiority vs ground control creates strategic rock-paper-scissors
- **Tech Progression:** Not just unlocks, but represents the technological evolution of the First Robotech War

## 🎨 Design Philosophy

### Core Principles

**1. Respect Player Intelligence**
- No hand-holding after tutorial
- Trust players to discover strategies
- Provide tools, not prescriptions

**2. Systems Over Scripting**
- Emergent gameplay > scripted events
- Replayability through procedural generation
- AI personalities create variety

**3. Clarity Over Flash**
- Readable UI beats pretty UI
- Clear feedback > animations
- Performance > eye candy (for now)

**4. Prototype First, Polish Later**
- Gameplay mechanics before art assets
- Test core loops with primitives
- Data-driven design enables rapid iteration

**5. Non-Commercial Integrity**
- Fan project respecting IP holders
- Open development for learning
- MIT license for code, not assets

## 🎯 Target Player Experience

### Session Flow

**Early Game (Turns 1-30):**
- Exploration and expansion
- Founding first cities
- Securing strategic resources
- Early skirmishes over territory
- *Player feeling:* "Where should I settle? What's beyond the fog?"

**Mid Game (Turns 31-60):**
- District specialization
- Tech race for advanced units
- Territorial consolidation
- Major battles for key positions
- *Player feeling:* "How do I outmaneuver my opponent? When to attack?"

**Late Game (Turns 61+):**
- Elite units (Armored Veritechs, Officer Pods)
- All-out warfare or dominant victory
- Racing to conquest or overwhelming tech advantage
- *Player feeling:* "Can I finish them before they tech up? One more push!"

### Emotional Beats

**Discovery:** "Oh, there's a Protoculture deposit here!"
**Anticipation:** "Two more turns until I unlock Armored Veritechs..."
**Tension:** "Their army is approaching - do I defend or counter-attack?"
**Triumph:** "I just transformed mid-combat and flanked their artillery!"
**Relief:** "Made it through their salvo with 5 HP left"
**Satisfaction:** "My district specialization is paying off - science is booming"
